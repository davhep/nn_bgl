2DO:
* Find and digitize motivated theory
* self-learning with out teacher
* Continous variant of optimization - math.ph like )))
* add MNIST interface
* Bug !!! - in analyze_model non-DAG result graph rarely comes
    2 6 6 1 configuration, update each 500 iterations

DONE:

* Visualize (2D surface animation) fitting progress
* boost options
* Control groupe checking (train vs control estimations)
* ok, adding synapses and neurons by correlation estimations
